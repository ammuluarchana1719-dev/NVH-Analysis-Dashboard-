# NVH-Analysis-Dashboard 
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze automotive Noise, Vibration, and Harshness (NVH) performance. The solution provides actionable insights through KPI monitoring, trend analysis, and comparative evaluation across driving conditions. A drill-through vehicle details page enables focused analysis at the individual vehicle level. The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in Power BI data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design using synthetic datasets.
